# PIDetector-MalwareSamples

Welcome to the PIDetector-MalwareSamples repository! This dataset is a collection of malicious samples used to test and evaluate the PIDetector application. PIDetector is designed to detect and analyze process injection techniques listed in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, specifically Process Hollowing and DLL Injection.

Note: PIDetector is currently not publicly available. When it becomes available, it will be accessible here.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a curated dataset of malicious samples for researchers and developers to test and benchmark process injection detection tools, including PIDetector. This dataset includes samples that employ process injection techniques and those that do not.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **DLL_Injection_Malware_Samples/**: Contains samples that employ the DLL Injection technique.
  - Note: These samples are specific to classic DLL Injection techniques.
- **Process_Hollowing_Malware_Samples/**: Contains samples that utilize the Process Hollowing technique.
- **Non-Injection_Malware_Samples/**: Contains samples that do not use either process injection technique.
  - Note: These samples might still use other process injection techniques.

Each directory contains subdirectories for individual samples, including relevant metadata and analysis reports.

## Usage

To use this dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/turalbaris/PIDetector-MalwareSamples.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Desired Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd PIDetector-MalwareSamples/Process_Hollowing_Malware_Samples/
   ```
   
3. **Select a Sample:**
   ```sh
   Use the password "infected" to extract the samples.
   ```
